The goal of this project is to write a program that will display the result of an evaluated mathematical ex-pression. 
The expression will be composed of infinite integers that can be expressed in any base.
The program must handle the following operators:+-*/%, parentheses, operation priorities and syntax errors,but not float numbers.

./calc -h for USAGE explanation.

Example :

echo ‘3+6’ | ./calc 0123456789 ‘()+-*/%’ 3
